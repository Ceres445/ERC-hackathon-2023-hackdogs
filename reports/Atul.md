## Task 2

Sin wave generator : https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dKuMHpZJDu7

### Overview
The circuit uses a 555 Timer IC to Convert a constant DC source of 9V to an Square wave and this square is then converted to near sinusoidal wave using an L-C circuit attached to the output of 555 Timer IC.

### Components Used

1. 555 Timer IC
2. 9V DC Battery (Power Source)
3. Inductors, Capacitors and Resistors (to generate the required wave)

## Task 3,4,6

Control Circuit : https://www.tinkercad.com/things/aWoxZKCfkJs

### Overview

This circuit assumes that it receives three parameters, STOP MODE ON/OF, LANDMINE FOUND/NOT FOUND and DISTANCE TO LANDMINE.
Using these 3 inputs it generates the required LED lighting and Buzzer Sounds.
Also the 7 - Segment Display shows the number of Landmines found.

### Components Used

1. Arduino (Brains of the circuit)
2. 2 x 7 Segment Displays (Count Display)
3. RGB LED
4. Buzzer
